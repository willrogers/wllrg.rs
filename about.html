          <h1>About me</h1>
          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>I work as a software engineer at Diamond Light Source in
            Oxfordshire, UK.  It's a synchrotron light source used for doing
            science; I work in the Control Systems group on software used
            for its operation.</p>
          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I do a lot of programming in Python. Some of the other code I write
            is in C and Java. My experiments with Javascript are on this
            site.</p>
          <p>Usually I program on Linux but at home I sometimes use a Mac.</p>
