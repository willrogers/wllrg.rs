		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the website for Elizabeth Tidy. It's here to give an idea of the sort of work I enjoy. It's not comprehensive, but a selection of my more polished pieces. I hope to keep adding to it as and when I think there's something of interest.</p>
<p>You're welcome to get in touch with me via the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a> on this site if you're interested in commissioning a work, or just want to know a bit more about what I do..</p>
<p>I hope you'll enjoy browsing the <a href="/art/">gallery</a> which offers some examples of my recent work.</p>
