		<p>The three canvases depict the sitter from different perspectives, and within each canvas two images are overlaid. This idea was taken in part from a triple portrait of Charles the First produced by van Dyke as a study from which Bernini could produce a bust (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anthonis_van_Dyck_041.jpg">Triple portrait of Charles the First by van Dyke</a>). In this work van Dyke also chose to combine multiple images taken from different viewpoints to give the best representation of the appearance of the sitter. </p>
